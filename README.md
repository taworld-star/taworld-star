I am an informatics student currently focusing on learning AI, machine learning, and data analysis. 
Although my project experience is still limited to academic assignments, I have worked on data analysis for my final project which involved data processing, visualization, 
and interpretation using SQL and Python.
I'm very interested in developing my skills in this field and am enthusiastic about contributing to projects that allow me to learn and grow. 
I actively participate in online courses and workshops related to data science and AI to expand my knowledge. 
I'm looking for opportunities that will allow me to apply and develop my data and AI skills in practical contexts
